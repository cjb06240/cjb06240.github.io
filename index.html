<h1 style="text-align:center"> Who's That Girl? </h1>
<p> Welcome to my html project! When challenged to create something that implements different aspects of html that was semi-interesting was rather difficult. The wide spectrum of possibilities were overwhelming, so I decided to just stick with what I enjoy and that is Netflix. Here, I will be describing the main characters of New Girl, and how they create a fun and entertaining show.</p>
<p style="font-family=Tahoma"><strong>Characters</strong></p>
<p><a href="jess.html">Jess</a></p>
<p><a href="nick.html">Nick</a></p>
<p><a href="schmitt.html">Schmitt</a></p>
<p><a href="winston.html">Winston</a></p>
<p><a href="cece.html">CeCe</a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:left">Why Do I Like This Show? </h2>
<p> To be quiet frank, I started watching this because it is <del>one of</del> my girlfriend's favortie show <em>(We were not dating at the time and I wanted to impress her)</em>, and it just kinda grew on me from there on. While this would not be something I would normally sit down and watch. When I started watching, I would pretend and tell her, <i>"Oh yes, I love this show, it is very hilarious and entertaining!"</i>. In reality, I was forcing myself to watch it until I learned to like it. But when I did learn to appreciate the show, the show really started to grow on me and even got me to submit some laughs. And if there can be laughs and a few tears can be retrieved from watching a show, then it is a successful show.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left">Why Would I Recommend This Show?</h3>
<p> This show is full of funny remarks and sometimes inappropriate jokes. It keeps onself engaged and interested, even when things start to repeat themselves. The characters of the show are all relatable and can be connected to emotionally. It has enough surprises in each season to keep interesting, and continues to surpass the expectations placed on the show in regards to entertainment. So I would recommend this series if you're into these type of shows.</p>
<p> If I had to choose my favorite characters in this show, it would go like this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Nick</li>
	<li>Winston <sub>(because of Ferguson)</sub></li>
	<li>Jess</li>
	<li>Shmidt</li>
	<li>CeCe</li>
</ol>
</p>Well, that is all I have for this show, I hope you enjoyed skimming through and learning a little bit about the characters â˜º</p>
